            <p>Santa, Geese, Deer, Jack O’ Lanterns, Lawn Jockeys, Flamingos, Frogs, Jesus. The choices we make, even the mundane act of placing a lawn ornament allows us to project to the world, to take ownership of our decisions. We place plastic, mass produced images of the divine on our lawns, The Madonna sometimes lives in a bathtub, a tender gesture, creating comfort and shelter for the one who comforts many. The Madonna is often seen painted in blue, as the pigment’s origin from lapis lazuli stones were rare and expensive, a concept important when portraying The Virgin. Why now do we portray her in blue when it is as created in plastic, is a plastic image of the divine still divine?</p>
