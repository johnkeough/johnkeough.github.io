                <h1>An Ode</h1>

                <p>I was born to a family of Laborers. Of Electricians and Plumbers, of Construction Workers, Nurses, and Janitors. By definition; “work hard; make great effort.” or “work, especially hard physical work”. Presumably, I should have followed the track of the women my senior, to become a nurse, a caretaker. Instead, I reside as the artist. My work has become my way of carrying the family labor, transcribing into the work the realization and recognition that comes with the shift from adolescence to adulthood, the reality of truths and lies, of white middle-class suburban propriety, the privileges that come with that way of living, the privileges I have carried.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    “I have been coming to terms with the history into which I was born, the people within that history, and the land on which I live, since before I could tie my shoes. Even then, I felt shame and some inchoate sense of accountability; the past haunted me from what seemed like the far side of time. Now, in this present, there is an urgent cry rising, one that compels me, again and again, to try to reconcile my love for this place with its brutal history.” (Sally Mann, 2017)</p>
